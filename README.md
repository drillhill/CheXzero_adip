# About this repository
This a fork from this [github](https://github.com/rajpurkarlab/CheXzero). To be more specific, you can click in the link or you can read the [AuthorREADME.md](https://github.com/drillhill/CheXzero_adip/blob/main/AuthorREADME.md) to know more about the model. This will sum up some of the information of the origin README. 

## About data
The data are from [MIMIC-CXR JPG] https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr-jpg/2.0.0/ and reports from [MIMIC-CXR Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/) Note: in order to gain access to the data, you must be a credentialed user as defined on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/).
The author used MIMI-CXR JPG for only train, but I will use it both for train and test. 
Note: Because the data is not public, you must be a credentialed user on [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/).

## About zero-shot inference
I make a notebook [chexzero-adip](https://github.com/drillhill/CheXzero_adip/blob/main/chexzero-adip.ipynb) included all the step after preprocessing the data as mentioned in **AuthorREADME.md**. You can follow these steps and run to see the result.
